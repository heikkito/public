# public
My public script code repository. Finished or otherwise working code along with user menus / docs are placed here. 

I work with Powershell, Python and some command line/.bat files along with Terraform, ARM-templates and helm-charts. No public repositories except this small public repository. 

I only publish fully working code here that compiles but may require to install modules to work. Check readme.txt for each script.
